1000000/4 = 250000

250000/8 = 31250

1/31250 = 32us

1/32us = 31250 counts for 1s delay

65535-31250 = 34285 initial timer set

1000010111101110 in 16 bit

10000101 = 133

11101110 = 238



with the timer starting from 0 the interval is about 2.08s which sounds about right (2.09 calculated)

starting from 34286 we get about 620ms, so that means that 



FUCK this I'll just divide the count by 1 / 2.09 = 0.478

62500 for 4:1 prescale

so 3035 initial set

0000101111011011
